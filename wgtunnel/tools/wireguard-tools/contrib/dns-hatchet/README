The DNS Hatchet
===============

This is a workaround for distributions without resolvconf or any proper
mechanism of setting the DNS. Running 'apply.sh` in this directory will
insert 'hatchet.bash` into the right place in 'wg-quick.bash`. It is
recommended that distributions without any resolvconf available run this
before calling 'make install` in their packaging scripts.
