                === IMPORTANT NOTE ===

Do not use these scripts in production. They are simply a
demonstration of how easy the `wg(8)` tool is at the command
line, but by no means should you actually attempt to use
these. They are horribly insecure and defeat the purpose
of WireGuard.
                     STAY AWAY!

That all said, this is a pretty cool example of just how
darn easy WireGuard can be.
